Í síðasta þætti af [D.O.N.G.](https://youtu.be/gFw-8PmrPwY) bentu þeir kútar á [sjálfspróf](http://richardstep.com/richardstep-strengths-weaknesses-aptitude-test/free-aptitude-test-find-your-strengths-weaknesses-online-version/) til að finna eigin styrkleika. Það er svolítið skrýtið að uppgötva í miðju prófi að ég veit ekki hvort ég sé að svara spurningunum sem óska-ég eða raun-ég. Ég ákvað að bíta í það súra epli og feisa heiminn og svaraði sem raun-ég. "You keep everyone on task and focused"... óska-ég segi nottla já! En raun-ég þarf að feisa það að það hefur ekkert alltaf gengið upp. Það er aðeins erfiðara að taka svona próf sem raun-ég.  

## Niðurstöðurnar

> ### Optimism (94%): 
* Look for positions where you can be as close to customers as possible.
* Actively help plan events - like new product launches and user groups.
* Do use your humor and good attitude to excite people.
* Being positive does not mean you'll be in good mood - be aware and let others know, as needed.
* Cynics quickly sap your energy and you dislike cheering negative people - minimize these instances.
* You enjoy celebrating and should actively find ways to recognize achievements.

Uuuu... ókei! Skal gert. Fíla allt sem stendur þarna og oftast eru þessir kostir taldir upp þegar verið er að auglýsa eftir verkefnastjórum eða mannauðsmanneskjum. Í byrjun sumars 2016 fannst mér svo sjálfsagt að ég myndi fljúga inn í næsta starf miðað við reynslu og umsagnir fyrrum samstarfsfólks. Bjartsýnin var mikil. Ég sótti um fá störf því ég var að leita að því eina rétta. Þegar ég fékk það ekki fór ég að efast... það er nefnilega ógeðslega erfitt að finnast maður ekki glataður þegar maður fær engin svör við atvinnuleit. 
<br><br>
> ### Determination (94%): 
* Constantly be on the lookout for new goals and improvements.
* You're good at initiating and organizing a project, start your own and help others.
* Get feedback from people as others' expectations will energize you.
* Actively participate in helping a bogged down team into action.
* When down, think of new improvements to do tomorrow - stay on track.
* Be careful of those who really want to project and analyze - they are a non-fit for your work style!
<br><br>

<br><br>
> ### Adaptability (88%): 
* Your success depends on ability to accommodate the unforeseen.
* You find planning work very boring - find ways to minimize this chore while still achieving.
* Get on teams that need to make progress - you won't sit around and sulk.
* Focus on many quick jobs/tasks rather than long, drawn-out assignments.
* Foster others' desire to learn and experiment by giving them room and tools.
* Goal-setting meetings and career-counseling are boring to you - minimize it.

> ### Leadership (88%): 
* You are good at getting projects moving again or persuading people to get stuff going - do it!
* Take opportunities to give evaluations of what is happening in company - your straight answers can help.
* You do not like to be supervised closely - make sure others are aware of this.
* You might empire-build, upset colleagues, get off-focus, ignore commitments - be aware and try to avoid.
* You may tend to intimidate others with up-front, aggressive style - let them know it is not personal.
* Your time may be better spent helping others understand you than trying to change you.
